# ðŸ§® Find the One in Matrix

A small JavaScript project to find the **greatest product of 4 adjacent numbers** in a matrix.  
Adjacent numbers can be **horizontal or vertical**.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Improvements
1. **Reusable horizontal sweep function** â€“ separated logic for clarity and reusability.  
2. **Matrix rotation function** â€“ rotate the matrix by 90Â° to reuse the horizontal sweep for vertical calculation.  
   - âœ… Easier to extend later (e.g., diagonals).  
   - âœ… Keeps code DRY and modular.
